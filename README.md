# Employee_Attrition
Predicting employee attrition using HR data
## Business Requirement
Predict the employee attrition using the HR data.
## ML Requirement
Attrition is the target variable represented as a Boolean field. Using features provided in the CSV file predict whether the employee will leave the organisation or not.
## Assumptions
1.	Since we do not have test data separately, we will use the Train-Test Split from SciKit-Learn for generating the test data (used to compute the performance metrics).
2.	Data is fictional and can result in a very low accuracy score- we will then opt for some-other metrics for model evaluation.
3. There is no Time-Series data for the attrition of employees which will result in some deviation.
